This is a simple script to remove branding from downloads, using this version of rename: http://rename.berlios.de/

It assumes rename exists in '/usr/bin' and is called either 'rename' or 'renamexm' (if there are two copies of rename on your system, renamexm would be the one with regular expressions)

There's not much too this script, but its licensed under the GPLv2; feel free to contribute more tags to the section at the top.
If the list begins to become unweildy in the future, it might eventually become time for a more creative way to manage them.

usage: assuming download-debrand is in your $PATH, run 'download-debrand' in the directory you'd like the changes to take place and it will rename all files in that directory, non-recursively.
